            "https://www.pcliquidations.com/collections/dell-laptops",

}
```

### Schedule Automatic Scraping

**Windows:**

   ```batch
   cd C:\Users\JR\Documents\PROJECTS\JEFF\crawl4ai
   python advanced_scraper.py
   ```
2. Add to Task Scheduler

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
# Add to crontab (daily at 2 AM)
0 2 * * * cd /path/to/crawl4ai && python advanced_scraper.py
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Dashboard shows no data
- Make sure `competitor_prices.json` exists
- Refresh the browser
- Check browser console (F12)

### Scraper finds no products
- Website structure may have changed
- Try the AI scraper instead
- Check if URLs are correct

### AI scraper fails
- Verify OpenAI API key is set correctly
- Check your API credits
- Use basic scraper as fallback

## 📊 Example Output

```json
{
  "brand": "Dell",
  "model": "Latitude 5420",
  "product_type": "Laptop",
  "price": 449.99,
  "config": {
