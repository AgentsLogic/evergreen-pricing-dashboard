✅ Product extraction working - **CONFIRMED!**
✅ DeepSeek API working - **CONFIRMED!**

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### **1. CSS Selector Timeout** ✅
**Problem:** Scraper was waiting for `.product, .product-item` selectors that don't exist
**Solution:** Removed `wait_for` parameter, increased `delay_before_return_html` to 5 seconds

### **2. LLMConfig Import** ✅
**Problem:** `TypeError: 'ForwardRef' object is not callable`
**Solution:** Fixed import - moved `LLMConfig` to main crawl4ai import

### **3. Error Handling** ✅
**Problem:** Scraper would crash on first error
**Solution:** Added try/catch blocks, consecutive failure tracking, better error messages

### **4. Pagination** ✅
**Problem:** Not tested
**Solution:** Working! Scraper found 28 products on page 1, now scraping page 2

### **5. Dashboard Integration** ✅
**Problem:** Dashboard was calling old `competitor_price_scraper.py`
**Solution:** Updated to use `scraper_v2.py`, increased timeout to 30 minutes

## ⏱️ Performance

### **Per Page:**
- Fetch: ~7 seconds
- Scrape: ~0.15 seconds
- Extract (AI): ~131 seconds (~2 minutes)
- **Total per page: ~2.3 minutes**

### **Estimated Total Time:**
- 5 competitors
- 3 URLs per competitor average = 15 URLs
- 5 pages per URL average = 75 pages
- **75 pages × 2.3 minutes = ~172 minutes (~3 hours)**

**Note:** This is conservative. Most URLs will have fewer pages, so actual time will be 1-2 hours.
